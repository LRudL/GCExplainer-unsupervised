# GCExplainer-unsupervised

NOTE: use previous commit if want to run gspan!!!
- most recent one breaks it (nx to pyg conversion)

This repository contains the code for a course project based on the paper: "GCExplainer: Human-in-the-Loop Concept-based Explanations for Graph Neural Networks" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.11889.pdf)

## Citing

The original paper can be cited as:
```
@article{magister2021gcexplainer,
  title={GCExplainer: Human-in-the-Loop Concept-based Explanations for Graph Neural Networks},
  author={Magister, Lucie Charlotte and Kazhdan, Dmitry and Singh, Vikash and Li{\`o}, Pietro},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.11889},
  year={2021}

```

## Requirements

A requirements file is located in the `k_clustering` folder. Simply create a virtual envrionment and run `pip install -r k_clustering/requirements.txt`

## Running Instructions

The repository provides a set of Jupyter Notebooks to make replication of the experiments as easy as possible.
